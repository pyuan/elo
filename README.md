A jQuery mobile, backbone.js and require.js application boiler plate based on the jQuery Mobile [sample tutorial](http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/pages/backbone-require.html).

"template_with_amd" uses require.js and follows the AMD pattern

"template_without_amd" loads in all the scripts up front synchronously and essentially emulates loading in a merged script for the most part
